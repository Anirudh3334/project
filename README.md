AIM:
To design and implement a real-time monitoring system that uses an MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope) with an OLED display to track and visualize the position and orientation of a moving object in simulation (Wokwi). The system will display live sensor data and calculated orientation angles.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Most systems struggle with accurately tracking orientation and motion in three dimensions in real time. We aim to create an affordable, portable solution that uses low-cost sensors and an OLED display to provide immediate feedback on position and orientation, useful for robotics, motion analysis, and wearable tech.
